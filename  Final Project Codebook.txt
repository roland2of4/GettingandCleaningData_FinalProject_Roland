Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project Codebook

1) Data Source

From the Coursera project introduction, we know the following about the data:
"One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing...Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

2) Data Source Structure
Originally the data is spread out in several different files, which have to be combined in a certain way to create a single dataset for the project. The files are as follows (this is from the dataset's readme.txt):
The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name. There are 6 potential types of activity.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 


3) Details on the Features (variables)
The original list of 410 features (variables) is in features.txt
There is a file called features_info text which provides the following background:
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'


4) Restructuring the Data Set
Here is the process followed to transform the original multiple files into a single data set and then into a second tidy dataset. 

##Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set for each type of info
##Combine all the Subject data, then Activity data, then Features data, ending up with 3 tables
dataSubject <- rbind(dataSubjectTrain, dataSubjectTest)
dataActivity<- rbind(dataActivityTrain, dataActivityTest)
dataFeatures<- rbind(dataFeaturesTrain, dataFeaturesTest)

## give the columns names
names(dataSubject)<-c("subject")
names(dataActivity)<- c("activity")
names(dataFeatures)<- dataFeaturesNames$V2

## merge columns into one dataframe
Data<- cbind(dataSubject, dataActivity, dataFeatures)

##find only column names containing "mean()" and "std()" in them. Now below has 68 vars.
namesMeanStdOnly <- grep("mean\\(\\)|std\\(\\)",dataFeaturesNames$V2,value=TRUE)

## put back together with SubjectActivity
namesSubjectActivity<-c(as.character(namesMeanStdOnly), "subject", "activity" )
Data<-subset(Data,select=namesSubjectActivity)

## replace data activity numbers with labels
factorizeActivityLabels <- factor(Data$activity)
levels(factorizeActivityLabels) <- activity_labels[,2]
Data$activity <- factorizeActivityLabels

## replace abbreviated names with full names
names(Data)<-gsub("^t", "time", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("^f", "frequency", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Acc", "Accelerometer", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Gyro", "Gyroscope", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("Mag", "Magnitude", names(Data))
names(Data)<-gsub("BodyBody", "Body", names(Data))

## make a tidy data set. First factorize subject, then apply mean, then arrange column order, then write table. 
Data$subject <- as.factor(Data$subject)
Data2<-aggregate(. ~subject + activity, Data, mean)
Data2<-Data2[order(Data2$subject,Data2$activity),]
write.table(Data2, file = "tidydata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
